Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in a Gameplay Programmer position with your team. I bring hands-on experience building gameplay systems, AI behaviors, and performance-focused logic in C++ and C#, along with the perspective that comes from shipping a commercially released indie title. I am passionate about creating mechanics that feel responsive, scalable, and polished, and I am excited to contribute that mindset within a collaborative studio environment.

My background is rooted in gameplay and systems programming. Across multiple projects, I have implemented combat mechanics, player progression systems, enemy AI driven by state machines, and performance-conscious logic designed to scale with content and difficulty. I’ve worked closely with designers and artists to translate creative goals into reliable, maintainable code, and I am comfortable owning features from early prototyping through final polish. Leading and collaborating with small to mid-sized teams has also given me a strong appreciation for clear communication, iteration, and shared technical standards.

After my time in the game industry, I made the practical decision to take roles in other industries to ensure stable and consistent income. While those positions were outside of game development, they reinforced habits that are directly applicable to production work—accountability, quality control, meeting deadlines, and working within established processes. Following a later layoff, I transitioned into independent stock market trading, which I have pursued for the past couple of years. That experience sharpened my analytical thinking, risk assessment, and discipline, while reinforcing my comfort working with complex systems and data-driven decision making.

Throughout this period, I stayed actively engaged with game development. I continued refining my programming skills, completed structured learning through platforms like LinkedIn Learning, earned credentials through IBM SkillsBuild, and kept my fundamentals sharp through regular problem-solving practice. I am now intentionally focused on reentering the game development industry as a gameplay programmer, where I can once again contribute to building engaging player experiences while continuing to grow technically.

I would welcome the opportunity to bring my gameplay-focused skill set, real-world development experience, and collaborative approach to your studio. Thank you for your time and consideration, and I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I could contribute to your team.

Sincerely,

Daniel J. Van Mensel
