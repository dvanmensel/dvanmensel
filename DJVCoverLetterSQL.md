Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in an entry-level SQL or data-focused role with your organization. I bring a strong foundation in SQL, data structures, and backend logic, supported by hands-on experience building and validating data-driven systems in production software. I am now looking to apply these skills in a role where data accuracy, reliability, and thoughtful analysis are essential.

My technical background includes designing systems that rely on structured data to drive behavior, progression, and reporting. While my early experience comes from software and game development, the core of my work has consistently involved modeling complex data, validating large datasets, and ensuring correctness across interconnected systems. I am comfortable writing and reasoning about queries involving joins, aggregations, and conditional logic, and I place a high value on clean data, clear documentation, and repeatable processes.

After my time in the tech and game development industry, I made a deliberate decision to accept roles in other industries to secure stable, consistent income. Although those positions were outside of technology, they strengthened my attention to detail, quality control habits, and ability to work reliably in structured, deadline-driven environments. Following a later layoff, I transitioned into independent stock market trading, which I have pursued for the past couple of years. That experience further sharpened my analytical thinking, discipline, and comfort working with data to identify patterns, manage risk, and make informed decisions.

Throughout this period, I remained committed to maintaining and expanding my technical skill set. I completed formal coursework in SQL and data-related topics through LinkedIn Learning, earned credentials through IBM SkillsBuild, and continue to practice problem-solving and query logic through platforms like HackerRank. I am now intentionally focused on reentering the tech industry in an entry-level SQL or data-oriented role where I can contribute reliably while continuing to grow.

I would welcome the opportunity to bring my analytical mindset, data-focused experience, and strong work ethic to your team. Thank you for your time and consideration, and I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my skills could support your data and reporting needs.

Sincerely,

Daniel J. Van Mensel
