Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in a Junior Software Engineer position with your team. I bring a strong foundation in C++ and C#, a background in systems-focused game development, and hands-on experience contributing to and leading engineering efforts on real, shipped software. I am now eager to apply those skills in a broader software engineering environment where I can continue learning while delivering reliable, well-structured code.

My technical background is rooted in object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, and performance-conscious system design. Through my work in indie game development, including a commercially released title, I’ve built and maintained gameplay systems, AI behaviors, and supporting tools while collaborating closely with designers, artists, and other programmers. These experiences strengthened my ability to translate requirements into maintainable code, debug complex issues, and work effectively within iterative development cycles.

After my time in the game industry, I made the practical decision to take on roles in other industries to ensure stable, consistent income. While those positions were outside of tech, they reinforced valuable professional habits such as accountability, quality control, time management, and clear communication—skills that carry directly into software engineering work. Following a later layoff, I transitioned into independent stock market trading, which I have pursued for the past couple of years. During that time, I continued sharpening my technical skills through structured learning, coding challenges, and hands-on practice, while also developing strong analytical thinking, risk evaluation, and discipline.

Today, I am intentionally focused on reentering the tech industry in a junior software engineering role. I have reinforced my fundamentals through ongoing education, earned credentials through IBM SkillsBuild, and maintained active coding practice through platforms like HackerRank. I am motivated, current, and ready to contribute as a reliable junior engineer who values clean code, collaboration, and steady growth.

I would welcome the opportunity to bring my technical background, real-world experience, and commitment to continuous improvement to your team. Thank you for your time and consideration—I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can contribute.

Sincerely,

Daniel J. Van Mensel
